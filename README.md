# React Basics

### What is React?

React is a javascript library for building user interfaces.

We know that HTML & CSS are used to build user interfaces. And Javascript is used to make the user interfaces interactive.

React makes building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces much simpler using one core concept...

To acheive that, to make _"building complex, interactive and reactive user interfaces simpler"_, React embraces the concept called **"Components"**.

### Components

_What exactly is a Component?_

Components are the building blocks that make up the user interface. So, basically _individual parts of the UI_.

_i.e: Header, Image, Forms, Sidebar, Body, Footer, etc._.

Inside a component is just a combination of HTML & CSS for styling and JavaScript code for some logic. They are combined together into a single code called Component.

### Why Components?

##### Reusability

Having reusable building blocks help us avoid repetition. Programming in general, it is good if we don't repeat ourselves.

##### Separation of Concerns

Having a separation of concern helps us with keeping our code base small, manageable and easy to maintain instead of having one large file which holds all the HTML code. Basically, don't do too many things in one and same place (function). So, we can split big chunks of code into multiple smaller functions.

##### React Code is built In A 'Declarative Way'

In React, a declarative approach is a programming paradigm where you describe what you want to acheive, rather than explicitly specifying the step-by-step instructions/commands/logic of the code for acheiving it.

This approach is in contrast to an imperative approach, where you provide explicit instructions on how to manipulate the DOM or update the user interface in response to changes in data or user interactions.

##### Difference between Declarative Programming vs Imperative

The difference between declarative and imperative code is that imperative code focuses on writing an explicit sequence of commands to describe how you want the program to do things while declarative code focuses on specifying the result of what you want to acheive.
